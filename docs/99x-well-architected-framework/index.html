market-winning products. This framework will guide you through the architectural best practices by looking at it from four different views. These are;</p><ul><li>Business architecture - focuses on customer success and market sense</li><li>Product architecture - focuses on technology, data, and nonfunctional requirement</li><li>Infrastructure architecture - focuses on the deployment/release pipelines, configuration transformation and management, automation and optimized lead-time into production, release security, release validation, release roll-back and release management strategies without being limited to cloud environments</li><li>Production architecture - focuses on maintaining a system in production. Involving in the day-to-day smooth running of the system.</li></ul><p>The 99X well architecture framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and developing a product that can run on any platform. By addressing relevant quality attributes, which is specific to each pillars, the stakeholders can clarify almost every gray areas to come up with right architecture style and patterns.</p><p>Further, by answering few fundamental questions lean how to use right architectural style, patterns, and technologies. As well as it will guide to take the right decisions when designing an architecture for a specific requirement.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="architecture-process"></a>Architecture process<a class="hash-link" href="#architecture-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Designing and building a right solution for a specific business requirement is a complex task. One way is to identify clear separation to make it simpler. Having a basic understanding of what needs to consider of each separation, will help to build a most suitable architecture for the complex business requirement.</p><p>The architecture of a system describes its non-functional requirements as style, patterns, and concepts. The technologies will describe how to implement functional requirements with addressing non-functional requirements. A proper software architecture and design needs to consider several factors. With 99 X, well architecture framework, we mention them as architecture views.</p><p>First, we need to have a proper idea of the business needs. What kind of problem that the customer going to be solved. What are the quality attributes that we need to address for the business need. Here, we called it as “Business Architecture”. From this view the 99X well architecture framework looks for the business need of the customer with applying relevant quality attributes.</p><p>Once we develop the business architecture, need to think of non-functional requirements and functional requirements. Based on those it needs to be identified which architectural style and architectural patterns that full-fill this requirements. To address this the relevant quality attributes will help to identify the parts to consider. Based on 99x well architecture framework, we call this view as “Product Architecture” .</p><p>As the next view, need to think about the infrastructure that most applicable for our product architecture. Infrastructure are the technologies, which helps to develop functional and non-functional requirements. Based on 99x well-known architecture, we call this view as “Infrastructure Architecture”.</p><p>Final step is how to make our product to day today running smoothly. To do this we need to address several quality attributes. This view is most important to make the availability, fault tolerance, and smoothly running the product with adding values to the customer. Based on 99x well architecture, we call this view as the “Production Architecture”.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="architecture-views"></a>Architecture Views<a class="hash-link" href="#architecture-views" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="business-architecture"></a>Business Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#business-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="definition"></a>Definition<a class="hash-link" href="#definition" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>When implementing a product, it is important to understand the why we are building the product, what is the problem we are trying to solve. This should also include how the product will be perceived by the users and the market in general. The business architecture of a product will provide answers to these questions.
When defining the business architecture, we can analyze the product from different aspects as below.</p><ul><li><p>User experience - It is vital that we understand the users who will be using the product. Identifying the different personas of users will help the stakeholders to identify the features that the product should support as well as how these features should be presented to the users. A user persona will analyze the demographic of a typical user, what is the purpose the user will be using the product. It is also important to identify the motivation the user chooses to use this product and what will get them to continue to use the product.</p></li><li><p>Technology sophistication - When using a product, a user has certain expectations that the product will provide implicitly. For example, in a banking application, they would expect it to be accurate (high reliability) and it is available at any time the user needs it (high availability). It is important that we identify these expectations and regulations early on along with identifying the features of the product. These facts will impact on the infrastructure architecture for example whether the product will be hosted in cloud or on-premise.</p></li><li><p>Regulation and Compliance - In every domain there can be regulation and compliance that a product must adhere to. For example when a product is planned to be used in Europe and contains personal identifiable information (PII) then the product should be GDPR compliant. Also of the product is in healthcare domain there are other regulations and compliances that should be adhered to. These will impact on how the features are delivered to the end users.</p></li><li><p>Market sense - A product either tries to solve a problem or will provide a solution to a requirement that the users themselves are not aware that they need. In case of trying to solve a problem that the users already aware, it is best to analyze what are the other products already available in the market. It is important to identify in addition to the common features, what are the pain points of the users who are already using an existing product and address them. This will make the product stand apart from the other existing products.</p></li><li><p>Customer success - Once a product is released to the market, it should be able to solve the problem that the users have and guide them to achieve their goal. The customer success is an important factor in defining the business architecture since it influences the features that will be included. If the features do not support and guide a user in achieving their goals, they will not be happy to continue using the product and move out to another one.</p></li><li><p>Budget - In addition to the features provided by the product, it is also important to get a sense of the prices in the market. If the product price is too high than other products already in the market, the users will be discouraged to move into the new product. Therefore, when designing a product, it is best to keep in mind the cost of implementing each features and supporting additional user expectations.
By identifying the necessary requirement for each aspect of the product, we will be able to come up with a comprehensive business architecture, which will set the tone of the product.</p></li></ul><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="driven-by"></a>Driven by<a class="hash-link" href="#driven-by" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Product owner, User, Sales, Dev team</p><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="impacted-personals"></a>Impacted personals<a class="hash-link" href="#impacted-personals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Stakeholders, customers, finances, market, partners, and suppliers</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="strategic-reasons"></a>Strategic reasons<a class="hash-link" href="#strategic-reasons" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Implementing a business architecture can be beneficial is scenarios such as </p><ul><li>Legacy modernization, </li><li>Globalization, </li><li>Regulatory compliance</li><li>Determining new market and joint venture development</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="key-areas"></a>Key areas<a class="hash-link" href="#key-areas" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Business Architecture is directly based on business strategy. It is the foundation for subsequent architectures, where it is detailed into various aspects and disciplines. To optimize its value, it is necessary to consider the business from a number of different perspectives. Combining each of those perspectives will help us to fully understand the organization as it exists today, and will give you a better understanding of how it needs to evolve into the future.</p><p>There are 4 key areas of business architecture.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="organization"></a>Organization<a class="hash-link" href="#organization" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The organization is the structure of the company that business architecture is being applied to. The organization is made up of business units that combine to represent all functions and departments within the company.</p><p>The organizational structure is a comprehensive view of the organizational elements to gain a perspective of the following components.</p><ul><li>Business Units - A business unit is a logical grouping of a set of software services. Typically, business units some of which are strategic business units are focused on geography or a portfolio of products/services, or a customer segment.</li><li>Locations - As the name suggests location stands for geographic locations. The sites are vital to understanding the focus of each site, the types of customer segments the place serves, the products and services the area focuses on, and the capabilities that are vital will help in developing an understanding of the needs and strengths of each site.</li><li>Departments - The departments are specialized groups units with specific domain skills that serve critical organizational functions.</li><li>Roles - A role is a specific type of organizational function where an individual or a group of individuals work on particular responsibilities in pursuit of a business outcome.</li></ul><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="capabilities"></a>Capabilities<a class="hash-link" href="#capabilities" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>A business capability is one of the key components of business architecture and is an expression of what a business does and can do. A business capability denotes “What” a business can do, whereas a business process outlines how a particular activity gets done. There are multiple capabilities, each of which is unique.</p><p>At an elemental level, a business capability is the encapsulation of the underlying functionality expressed abstractly.</p><p>A capability map can be used to generate visualizations of an organization based on the distinct business capabilities that make up what that organization does. This is generally viewed as the starting point for the business architect as it represents the most fundamental mapping of the business. However, there are a number of different aspects to each capability.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="value-streams"></a>Value Streams<a class="hash-link" href="#value-streams" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Value streams are one of the most important elements of business architecture. The value stream is depicted as an end-to-end collection of value-adding activities that create an overall result for a customer, stakeholder, or end user.</p><p>In modeling terms, those value-adding activities are represented by value stream stages, each of which creates and adds incremental stakeholder value from one stage to the next.</p><p>They provide an easily understood visualization of how an organization achieves value through a self-contained set of activities, and as such a map of a single value, the stream can easily contribute to an executive presentation or similar use case.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="information"></a>Information<a class="hash-link" href="#information" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>If capabilities represent what an organization does, information is the fuel that drives knowledge and understanding of how a business operates. Information is built on the organization’s data, but for it to be considered information, that data also requires context the business capabilities, processes, decision making, and so on that leverage the data.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="quality-attributes"></a>Quality attributes<a class="hash-link" href="#quality-attributes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="functional-suitability"></a>Functional Suitability<a class="hash-link" href="#functional-suitability" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>This characteristic represents the degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions. Businesses commonly operate under a functional structure because it groups people who have similar knowledge, and when used in a team environment, helps companies achieve their goals.</p><p>There are many advantages to employing a functional structure in your business and it allows you to implement ethical, enforceable standards regarding investments and the process within the organization.</p><p>BFSQ1: What are the constraints that need to be considered for functional suitability?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Performance requirements</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Operating constraints</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Accuracy and precision of the requirements</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Portability</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Accessibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Security</li></ul><p>BFSQ2: What is functional completeness and how can we achieve functional completeness in a business?</p><p>Functional completeness is the degree to which the set of functions covers all the specified tasks and user objectives in business. Consider the following steps to achieve functional completeness in your system.</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Identify what process needs to implemented</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Analyze the pain points</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Conduct a root cause analysis</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Design and evaluate</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Implement the new process</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Evaluate and quantify</li></ul><p>BFSQ3: What are the quality measurements which can be used to maintain the quality of your product?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Performance</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Features</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Reliability</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Conformance</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Durability</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Serviceability</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Perceived quality</li></ul><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="usability"></a>Usability<a class="hash-link" href="#usability" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily. Usability depends on how well its features accommodate users’ needs and contexts. This is one of the keys to the user experience.</p><p>BUQ1: How can you increase the usability of your application?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Reduction in loading time</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Optimize functionality</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Ensure consistency</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Readability</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Error prevention and recovery</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Help and documentation</li></ul><p>BUQ2: Who are the actors that need to be considered to design and improve the usability of the software product?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Users</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Database systems</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Clients and servers</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Cloud platforms</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Devices</li></ul><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="compatibility-integrations-extensibility"></a>Compatibility (Integrations, Extensibility)<a class="hash-link" href="#compatibility-integrations-extensibility" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Compatibility is the capacity for two or more systems to work together without having to be altered to do so. Compatible software applications use the same data formats. For example, if image processor applications are compatible, the user should be able to open their image files in either product.</p><p>BCQ1: How do you achieve compatibility?</p><p>Compatibility is responsible for a software product to test that it works well across different configurations, platforms, versions, and devices based on the user&#x27;s requirements. It mainly focuses on delivering consistent and high-quality performance. Consider the following to identify compatibility.</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Infrastructure compatibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Operating system compatibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Software compatibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Data storage compatibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> 3rd party integration compatibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Browser compatibility</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Devices compatibility</li></ul><p>Integrations are responsible for bringing together multiple business systems to operate as a collaborative unit. When we consider business architecture this often refers to software or system integrations. The integration allows us to share information between connected systems and these integrations can vary in their functionality.</p><p>For example, a point of sale (POS) system can connect its customer data to its CRM, or integrations can be requesting information from a website/internal system and exchange their information by sending and receiving information between multiple systems in multiple locations.</p><p>BIQ1: How do you achieve the best use of software integrations?
Consider the below integration types while designing an integration.</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Star Integration - the process of developing connections within all software subsystems</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Horizontal Integration - method of establishing a system for communication such as message transmission and message monitoring</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Vertical Integration - fast and inexpensive option for software unification which develops functional entities for their software systems and vertically syncs them</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Common Data Format Integration - help businesses by providing data translation and promoting automation</li></ul><p>BIQ2: What are the steps and best practices that can be followed in the software integration process?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Collect definitions, requirements, and specifications</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Analyze the information</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Develop architecture and management plans</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Create the software integration system</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Begin using the integration system</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Evaluate system performance periodically</li></ul><p>BIQ3: What are the factors need to be identied for software integrations?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Data format</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Integration pattern</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Enhanced authentication and authorization</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Testing environment</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Audit data</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Continuous testing software</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Maintain situational awareness</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Security</li></ul><p>Extensibility is a measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the extension. Extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality.</p><p>The attribute provides for enhancements without impairing existing system functions. For example, Integrated development environments (IDEs) are applications that facilitate the development of other applications and the supported extensions and plugins for the IDEs will allow the users to customize their environment based on their preferences.</p><p>BEQ1: Have you identified the extensibility consideration?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Multitenancy</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Multi-Region</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Latency</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Consistency</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Internationalization</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Marketing and branding</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Geographical regions</li></ul><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="productization"></a>Productization<a class="hash-link" href="#productization" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Productization is the strategy of turning an internal business capability into a commercially viable product. It is an area that businesses are more focused on to scale their business, increase revenue, and reduce operational costs. It is the process of converting a core application/service you offer into a product you can implement or market across a larger user base. This makes possible the opportunity for exponential growth.</p><p>Productizing an application can lead to new external revenue streams and also the underlying architecture used to build the application can be served as a blueprint even if there are no common end users in which to market a new product and make an entry into the industry. Also, this provides a better framework to maintain the product behavior and the functionality more consistent by evolving the application over time.</p><p>BPQ1: What are the factors which need to be considered for productization?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Branding</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Subscription</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Licence</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Standard</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Target market</li></ul><p>BPQ2: What are the stages which can be considered for productization process?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Independent Projects - Executed independently and differ in the budget, technology, and functionality</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Project Feature Reuse - Focus on feature reuse across projects</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Product Recognition - Shared features between projects and customer specific maintenance</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Product Platform - Generic product platform with handing customer requirement as a market requirement</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Standardizing Product Platform - Focus on generic product platform and requirements are derived based on the market trends</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Customizable Software Product - Standard product with customized layered par focusing on services</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Standard Software Product - Generic product for all customers and build for a specific market and completely configurable and structured for subscription based model</li></ul><p>BPQ3: What are the challenges in the productization transformation process?</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Reuse documentation</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Delta analysis and effort estimation</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Version proliferation</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Architectural drift</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Over featuring</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> Security risks</li></ul><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="provision-for-known-unknowns"></a>Provision for Known unknowns<a class="hash-link" href="#provision-for-known-unknowns" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Known Unknowns are assumptions that we haven’t or can’t validate.
